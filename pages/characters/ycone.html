    <p>"It ain't easy being yellow" -Yellow Cone, not said in game.</p><br><br>
    <p>Yellow Cone is Cone's business partner in Cones in Space, in the intro of the game she tells you to survive a year on this planet, resulting in the rest of the game ensuing.</p>
    <p>Yellow Cone claims she will rescue Cone from the planet after the mission is complete, however after the year is complete Yellow Cone crashes her ship onto the planet as well, so the two of you must search for the missing parts of her ship that broke off.</p>
    <p>Yellow cone's ship parts can be found in the following locations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Tomb Dungeon</p></li>
      <li><p>Fire Dungeon</p></li>
      <li><p>Bought from the green man professor</p></li>
      <li><p>The Larptic Core will give you one upon speaking to it</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once all ship parts are collected you can enter yellow cone's rocket and beat the game.</p>
    <p>Prior to Cones in Space Yellow Cone worked at Cone Space Flyers Inc as a scientist, who studied newly discovered fauna and flora.</p>
    <p>After Cones in Space she joins Cone in the Larptic Extinction Corps, and makes ground breaking discoveries towards the biology of larptic creatures.</p>
