    <p>"I AM ETERNAL" -The Larptic Core speaking to cone after being defeated, and shortly before being blown up.</p><br><br>
    <p>The Larptic Core is the ultimate evil in Cones in Space, as he is responsible for the larptic fog that you spend almost the entire game avoiding, he also has mind control over a majority of the enemies (only the larptic infected ones)</p>
    <p>The Larptic Core is a mass of intelligent sentient sludge that has been around since the dawn of time, a mass of microorganisms came together into one spot, somehow forming larptic sludge, thus, the larptic core was born</p>
    <p>The Larptic Core has mind control over any creature with larptic infection, or made out of larptic sludge, however, larptic sludge can be manipulated to break the control, and be used for useful purposes</p>
    <p>The Larptic Core can form himself out of any larptic sludge anywhere in the universe, the only way to get rid of the Larptic Core for good, is to get rid of all the larpticity</p>
    <p>In the non-canon "larptic ending" the entire cone homeworld is infected by larpticity, as the trinket the Larptic Core gave you was a trap.</p>
    <p>In the non-canon "Bad ending" Cone breathes in the larptic fog, and becomes a zombie, demonstrating the effects of larpticity.</p>
    <p>The Larptic Core is a non-hostile NPC Until he swats down your ship and fights you as the final boss, he has a multitude of larptic enemies he can spawn, and launches larptic infused fire balls.</p>
    <p>The Larptic Core is also a highly skilled inventor (despite being dismembered as of Cone's first meeting with the Larptic Core), as he has invented some very high tech tools, such as: The larptic reactor, the larptic saber, and the body builder.</p>
