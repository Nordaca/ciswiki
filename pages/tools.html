    <h1>Tools</h1>
    <p><em>Full List as of 2.5.1</em></p>
  </div>
  <div class="wikibody">
    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <p>Tools are pieces of equipment specifically engineered to cone usage, some tools require a resource called "coneage" (what cones call concentrated beams of gamma rays) see below how to get coneage.</p>
    <div class="wikibody">
      <h3 style="font-size: 130%">Coneage</h3>
      <p>Coneage is crafted in the Cone Builder, they can be crafted with 5 wood, and restore 10 coneage upon consumption, coneage can also be used to craft cones of life to increase max health in case you die.</p>
      <h3 style="font-size: 150%">Melee Weapons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Green Stick: the green stick is the weakest melee in cones in space, it can be crafted with green rocks.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cone Butter Knife: the cone butter knife is a blue butter knife, it can be crafted with blue rocks.</p></li>
        <li><p>Fit Sword: the fit sword is a red sword, it cann be crafted with red rocks</p></li>
        <p>Melee weapons aren't very useful: so you'll mostly just use these items to craft the goober sword, which is significantly better than all of these</p>
      </ul>
      <h3 style="font-size: 150%">Ranged Weapons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Gun: The gun is a standard-issue Cone Flyers Inc. long-distance assault weapon, fires coneage, and is by far the weakest ranged weapon.</p></li>
        <li><p>Book of Coneile: A book that can somehow shoot out coneage, it's the best early game ranged weapon as it is easily crafted and deals decent damage.</p></li>
        <li><p>Book of Coneile II: An upgraded version of the book of coneile, it's a good ranged weapon until you get the Goob Sword.</p></li>
        <li><p>Book of Coneile III: A book of coneile that shoots out three beams of coneage at once, it's great for clearing out large areas!</p></li>
        <li><p>Book of Coneile V: The ultimate book of coneile. Made from shreddings of the other books, it can only be crafted by speaking to the professor on flesheria</p></li>
        <li><p>Mace: The Mace is a swinging ball, you can swing it around to do some backup damage.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h3 style="font-size: 150%">Ranged Swords</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Goob Sword: A sword that can fire coneage from the tip, it's a fairly decent ranged weapon, and it'll do until you can get the Goober Sword.</p></li>
        <li><p>Goober Sword: A sword that can fire large amounts of coneage from its tip. It's the second best ranged weapon in the game, and it'll do until you can get the Larptic Saber.</p></li>
        <li><p>Larptic Saber: A Saber designed by the Larptic Core, it can be crafted in the larptic reactor, and was used by the larptic core's forces to invade planets. The Larptic Saber is the best ranged weapon in the game, and can fire out extremely large amounts of larptified coneage.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h3 style="font-size: 150%;">Shields</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Cone Shield: A blue shield, fairly standard. It can be crafted using blue rocks. Hold shift to use it.</p></li>
        <li><p>Fit Shield: A red shield. It's decent at defending you, and can be crafted using red rocks.</p></li>
        <li><p>Goob Shield: A fairly good shield, it'll do until you can get the Goober Shield. Crafted with teeth.</p></li>
        <li><p>Goober Shield: The second best shield in the game, it'll do you until you can get the Larptic Shield.</p></li>
        <li><p>Larptic Shield: The best shield in the game, it's so defensive that almost nothing can pierce it.</p></li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
      <p>Early-Game melee weapons are, in general, not very desirable. Avoid melee options outside of ranged swords.</p>
      <p>There is a green man professor on an island to the north west on Flesheria, he can upgrade your tools for you!</p>
      <p>The Upgraded Green Man Staff allows you to place "Civilized Green Men", whom you can trade with.</p>
