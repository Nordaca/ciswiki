    <p>Cones in Space is a survival game created by a_coneish_one, and in this guide, we will go over some of the basics you should know about Cones in Space!</p>
    <p>Green Bar:</p>
    <p>	The Green bar at the top left of your screen is your health, and it lowers when you take damage (duh) you have a maximum of 10 health, and once it reaches 0 you die. After you respawn from dying, your max hp will be lowered by 1, and stops when your max hp has reached 1. the only way to restore your max hp is by crafting the "cone of life" which can be found in the first "Misc" tab of the cone builder</p>
    <p>Hunger and Saturation Bars:</p>
    <p>There is a yellow bar under your health bar. This yellow bar is your saturation, most foods restore saturation, and once your saturation runs out you start losing hunger.</p>
    <p>Underneath the yellow bar, there is an orange bar, this orange bar is your hunger. Your hunger begins to run out when you're out of saturation, oncce your hunger reaches 0 you start to take damage. Hunger and Saturation can be replenished by eating food, like berries or oranges</p>
    <p>Tempurature Bar:</p>
    <p>	Towards the left of your screen there's a thermostat, this is your tempurature bar. Your tempurature starts at 5 (lukewarm), raises when you get hot, and lowers when you get cold. Your tempurature lowers if you are near a fan, if you're on a cold planet, or if it's winter. Your tempurature raises if you are near a campfire, if you're on a hot planet, or if it's summer.</p>
    <p>	You can keep your tempurature at 5 forever if you craft a thermal pad, which basically removes tempurature from the game.</p>
    <p>	You can also affect your tempurature by eating some foods, like slushies or hot dawgs</p>
    <p>What you should do early game:</p>
    <p>One of the first things you should do in cones in space, is build a house or find shelter. Once you have a house in Cones in Space the enemies basically can't get you.    </p>
    <p>You should also try to find food, cuz like a cones gotta EAT</p>
    <p>	After you have your base set up, you should work towards crafting a rocket, you need 200 wood and 4 rocks to craft a rocket, to get a lot of wood very fast is to keep planting a crap ton of trees in your base, once you have the cone rocket, you can travel to other planets</p>
