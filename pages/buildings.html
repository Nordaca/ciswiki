    <h2>Crafters</h2>
    <p>Crafters are standard "mass-instantiation" technologies created by Cones. They scan nearby solar systems and synthesize avaliable materials accordingly, including inventions created by other species.</p>
    <div class="wikibody">
      <h3 style="font-size: 140%">Cone Builder</h3>
      <p>A standard mass instantiator that can synthesize basic machinery, tools, and compounds. Some useful things you can craft are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Cone Rockets (Required to beat the game)</p></li>
        <li><p>Larptic Tissue (Required to beat the game)</p></li>
        <li><p>Larptic Cure (Required to beat the game)</p></li>
        <li><p>Radios (Required to beat the game)</p></li>
        <li><p>Tombs (Required to beat the game)</p></li>
        <li><p>Ranged Weaponry</p></li>
        <li><p>Larptic Reactor</p></li>
        <li><p>Boat Builder</p></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="wikibody">
      <h3 style="font-size: 140%">Rocket Builder</h3>
      <p>An advanced mass instantiator designed to specifically make rockets with standard functionality (Not to be confused with Cone Ships, which are manufactured by Cone Flyers Incorporated). It can be found by defeating the boss "Mega Muncher" on MB-2. You can craft more rocket builders once obtaining your first one.</p>
      <p>Some useful things you can craft are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Rocket Builder (Required to beat the game)</p></li>
        <li><p>Tier II Rocket (Required to beat the game)</p></li>
        <li><p>Thermal Rocket (Required to beat the game)</p></li>
        <li><p>Wormhole Rocket (Required to beat the game)</p></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="wikibody">
      <h3 style="font-size: 140%">Boat Builder</h3>
      <p>An optional mass instantiator, specifically designed to instantiate floatation devices, as well as modules one would typically put on said devices.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wikibody">
      <h3 style="font-size: 140%">Medicine Machine</h3>
      <p>An optional work station, specifically designed to create chemical formulas known as "Elixirs". Can be found after defeating the Transmitor in the Nexus.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>DMG Elixir. Increases muscle mass making Cones pack a harder punch (with weapons, of course)</p></li>
        <li><p>DEF Elixir. Increases a Cone's muscle tissue strength, making said Cone more durable. </p></li>
        <li><p>SPD Elixir. May or may not be liquid steroids.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="wikibody">
      <h3 style="font-size:140%">Larptic Crafters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Larptic Reactor: An optional mass instantiator crafted by the Larptic Core. It is able to create advanced bio-tech. Can be found by getting a blueprint by speaking to the Larptic Core.</p></li>
        <li><p>Body Builder: An optional mass instantiator also crafted by the Larptic Core. It is able to craft body parts for the Larptic Core. Can be found by getting a blueprint by speaking to the Larptic Core.</p></li>
