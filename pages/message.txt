Crafters. Crafters are standard fabricator technologies created by Cones, they scan nearby solar systems and synthesise avaialbe materials accordingly, including inventions created by other species

Cone Builder
	A standard fabricator that can synthesise basic machinery, tools, and compounds.
	Some useful things you can craft are:
		Cone Rockets (required to beat the game)
		Larptic Tissue (required to beat the game)
		Larptic Cure (required to beat the game)
		Boat Builder
		Larptic Reactor
		Radios (required to beat the game)
		Tombs (required to beat the game)
		Ranged Weaponry
Rocket Builder
	An advanced fabricator specifically designed to make rockets with standard functionality (not to be confused with cone ships, which are manufactured by cone flyers inc.)
	Can be found by defeating the Mega Muncher on MB-2, you can craft more rocket builders once obtaining one
		Some useful things you can craft are:
		Rocket Builder
		Tier II Rocket (required to beat the game)
		Thermal Rocket (required to beat the game)
		Wormhole Rocket
Boat Builder
	An optional facricator, specifically designed to fabricate floatation devices, as well as modules one would typically put on said device
	Can be crafted with the Cone Builder
Medicine Machine
	An optional fabricator, designed with the ability to produce advanced chemical formulas called "elixrs" these elixrs can produce strange affects to a cone's body.
	Can be found from defeating a boss in the Nexus
	The Elixrs you can craft are:
		DMG elixr, increases muscle mass making cones pack a harder punch
		DEF elixr, increases a cones tissue strength making cones more durable
		SPD elixr (may or may not be drinkable steroids)
Larptic Reactor
	An optional fabricator created by the larptic core, it is able to create advanced bio-tech
	Can be found by getting a blueprint by speaking to the larptic core
Body Builder
	An optional fabricator created by the larptic core, it is able to craft body parts for the larptic core
	Can be found by speaking to the larptic core on the other larptic planet
